About My JS Application
=======================

My JS Application, as the name suggests, is nothing but an
application written in JS. It installs, and it runs.
It's meant as an example of the GNOME application platform,
and in particular Gtk, Gd and the Gjs package system.

It should also work as a template for developing a real
application, ie. one that does something, without spending
all the time doing build system configuration.

Features
========

My JS Application most of the familiar UI you'd expect
from a core application: it has a main window with a header
bar, it has a search bar and it has multiple page stack.

On the developer side, the most prominent feature is
that My JS Application runs uninstalled without special
environment variables or command line args, ie you should
be able to run './src/my-js-app' and stuff should just
work. Or even better, you should be able to press the
F3 in Anjuta.

Also, it features an util module, which deals with
GtkBuilder and GtkCssProvider, again providing
transparency between the installed and not installed cases.

License
=======

Most of the package is under a 3-clause BSD license, to
make it suitable for inclusion in any application.
libgd, which is only included as a submodule but is part
of the tarball distribution, is under the LGPLv2+.
